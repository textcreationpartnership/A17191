            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13134:3"/> our only, perfect &amp; ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, to our endeleſſe comfort, and that our footeſteeppes might be directed to walke in the pathes of righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life, to the glorifiing of his holy name. Neither hath he dealt more graciouſly with any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then with this our Realme of England, wherein the profeſſours of the Goſpel liue ſafe from the foraine enemie, and free from perſecution at home, as it were in a Citie of refuge, and a priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Sanctuarie, when as our neighbours round about vs, taſte either of the one, or feele the ſmart of the other. And this hath hee brought to paſſe by the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his faithfull ſeruaunt Queene Elizabeth, our moſte vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Debora, who by the
<pb facs="tcp:13134:3"/> mightie power of her Lorde our God, hath woorthily triumphed ouer Idolatrie, which is nothing elſe but ſpiritual tyrannie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the conſciences of her ſubiects were more grieuouſly afflicted, than were the auncient Iſraelites by the nine hundred iron charrets of cruell captayne Syſara. God graunt, that ſhee may iudge vs double the yeeres, which Debora iudged Iſraell, and that her hand may ſtill proſper and preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Roomiſh Iabin vntill he bee vtterly deſtroyed, and yet, all theſe his gratious giftes ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly beſtowed vppon vs notwithſtanding, ſuch is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature, and the vnthankfulneſſe of our mindes, that in ſome, pure Religion bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpiſed, the ſtinking roote of Superſtition remaineth ſtill,

And therfore may the godly well ſay with Dauid:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Woe is me, that I am conſtrained to dwell with Meſech: and to haue mine habitation among the tents of Cedar.</hi> One chief cauſe of the great increaſe of theſe twoo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinnes, is the ſiniſter opinion diuerſly conceiued touching God his worde, when as the ſuperſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thinke it not ſufficient, to lead vs to the perfect knowledge of all things, neceſſary for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the wicked worldlinges
<pb facs="tcp:13134:4"/> ſo little eſteeme it, that they make a ieſt of it. If this crooked opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of both theſe kinde of men might bee ſo ſtreightened, that they would at the laſte reade and heare God his worde, with a full perſwaſion, that it is the perfect rule of Faith, and the plaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life, it is, to bee hoped, that theſe two naughtie trees, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Atheiſme, would bee in ſhort time, if not plucked vppe by the roote foorth of the Lordes garden, yet at the leaſt ſo ſnagged and mangeled, that the pleaſaunt trees thereof, that is to ſaye, the godly, ſhould haue the more roume to ſpreade abrode their fruitefull braunches. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we looke to ſee this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie chaunge in men before God his woord, to be read and hearde with confidence and followed
<pb facs="tcp:13134:5"/> with diligence. For if the earth, be it neuer ſo fatte, it cannot bring forth fruite before it haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſeede, much leſſe can man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature barraine grounde, bring foorth the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, before he haue receiued into his heart Gods word, which is the incorruptible ſeede, wherby we are borne anew. And as we reſt in hope, after the ſeede is throwne into the grounde, that God will ſend downe the dew of heauen to water the ſame, that it may bring forth fruit in due ſeaſon: ſo if men woulde receiue the ſeede of Gods woorde into their hearts, it were greatly to be hoped, that God of his mercie woulde cauſe it to take roote, and woulde with the dewe of his grace ſo water it, that the barraine ſoile woulde become good grounde, and the noyſome

Truely it is an horrible blaſphemie to ſay, that the holy ghoſt hath ſo doubtfully ſet forth this his doctrine, which is the onely and true wiſdome, &amp; vnderſtanding of the church, that it muſt bee expounded by man his wiſdome: and left it ſo obſcure, that it
<pb facs="tcp:13134:53"/> muſt bee made plaine by man his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                  <hi>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my wordes ſhall in no wiſe paſſe away.</hi> The Scripture recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her ſtrength or authoritie chiefely from GOD, from whom it was reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: that is to ſay, that it came not by the will of men,<note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16. 2. Pet. 1.21.</note> but that the men of GOD, beyng mooued by the holie Ghoſte, both ſpake and wrote: whom beeyng choſen and elected for this office, GOD adorned with manye and ſundrie myracles and diuine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies: So that there is no doubte at all, but that thoſe thinges were geuen from GOD by inſpiration whiche they wrote and ſette downe.
<pb facs="tcp:13134:64"/> And the ſelfe ſame ſpirite, which hath cauſed theſe thinges to bee written, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, that they are not the inuentions of men. And when the ſpirite of GOD doeth herein witneſſe to our ſpirit, &amp; ſeale vp the Scripture in our heartes, the faythfull ſoule doeth marueilouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and is greatly confirmed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we being illuminated by the vertue of the ſpirit, doe not nowe beleeue, either through our own iudgement, or through the iudgement of other, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of God: but doe moſt certainlie perſwade our ſelues aboue mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, none otherwiſe then if wee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde therein the power of God, that the Scriptures are come vnto vs, euen from the verie mouth of God by the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of men. Therefore the Spouſe in the Ballets ſayeth with marueilous ioy: <hi>My beloued ſayd vnto me.</hi> I ſaye nothing of that,<note place="margin">Cantic. 2.11.</note> which euerie one, which is lightned with the light of true fayth, muſt needes finde by experience in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. By this experience wrote once <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the man of God,<note place="margin">Confeſ. lib, 6. cap. 5.</note> howe God by a little and a little tempered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

Therefore the authoritie of the Scripture doth depend not of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churche, but of the inwarde teſtifying of the holy Ghoſt. And <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſſeth, that Chriſt ſayd thus, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpirite:<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.42.43.</note> 
                  <hi>If God were your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why do ye not know my ſpeach?</hi> For it is moſt certaine, that we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted to be the ſonnes of GOD, by the meanes of the holie Ghoſt. Which when we haue obteined, Chriſt witneſſeth in this place, that wee by the lightning of the ſame Spirite, may ſo diſcerne his ſpeache from a ſtrangers, that it may be manifeſt and certaine vnto vs. In the which ſelfe ſame ſenſe, Chriſt ſayth alſo in another place.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.2, 3, 4, 5.</note>

I would ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they ſhould tell mee, which bee thoſe chiefe bookes of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which haue authoritie from the church, which they could neither haue of themſelues, nor of their authours. And it may be gathered forth of thoſe thinges, which I haue alledged now forth of the newe Teſtament, how the Canon of the Scripture of the newe Teſtament was made, and from whence the Canonicall Scripture hath that excellent authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Therefore the Church receiued this Canon from the Apoſtles, confirmed by no Councell, and deliuered it, as it were from hande to hande, vnto the poſteritie.
<pb facs="tcp:13134:70"/> Wherefore <hi>Iohn</hi> in the ende of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, addeth both his owne teſtimony, and alſo the witneſſe of the Church, when as he ſaith:<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.24.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſame diſciple is he, which teſtifieth of theſe things, &amp; wrote theſe things, and we know that his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is true.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The teſtimonie of the Church concerning the ſcripture.</note> And this teſtimonie of the Church is not the deuiſe of man, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, &amp; ſuch a confeſſion, as is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the truth of the thing it ſelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we will intreate more at large in the place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient. And ſince they do ſo pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhly contend, that the authoritie of the Scripture doeth depend of the Church, why do they not bring forth ſome canon, or decree of ſome councell, whereby holie ſcripture was approued, or confirmed? The primitiue Church of the Chriſtians found the bookes of the olde Teſtament, authentical &amp; firme: and by them appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; confirmed the articles of our faith. Afterwards ſucceeded the bookes of the Apoſtles, written by the inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirite of God, which no decree of man confirmed. For Gods word is not ſubiect to mans will and pleaſure, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatſoeuer the Churches ordeyned,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13134:70"/> they alwayes were careful, to proue it by the word of God, as it may be proued by the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels of beſt credite. So that well wrote bleſſed <hi>Siluianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles: All other things, that is to ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Siluianus de vero iudicio &amp; proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia Dei. lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſayinges of men, haue neede of profes, and witneſſes: but the word of God is a witneſſe to it ſelfe: for it muſt needes bee an vncorrupt witneſſe of truth, which vncorrupt truth ſpeaketh</hi> In deede the Councels haue made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall of the bookes of holy ſcripture written by inſpiration from God, which ſome of the auncient fathers haue done alſo: as of the <hi>Greekes, Melito, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria:</hi> and of the <hi>Latines, Cyprian</hi> Biſhop and Martyr, and <hi>Hierome</hi> Prieſt. But long before their iudgement, the bookes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture had diuine authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong chriſtians, which they would haue had, although Councels had neuer bene celebrated. Notwithſtanding the holy men of God thought good to giue foorth their ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were wickedly be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> canonical bokes.</p>
               <p>If the Church were able to bring to
<pb facs="tcp:13134:71"/> paſſe, that the Scripture might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, certainly ſhe would haue perſwaded long before this time, Epicures, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudikes, and Mahometiſtes to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it.<note place="margin">All the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which the Church hath, hangeth on Gods worde.</note> For the authoritie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doeth not hang on the Church: but what authoritie ſoeuer the Church hath, it hangeth wholy on the worde of God. And if the authoritie of God his woorde decay, the authoritie of the Church muſt needes decay with it. For if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of them, howe they proue the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church, or howe they bee certaine, that it erreth not in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of holy Scriptures, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them from others? They will ſay: becauſe it is gouerned by the holie Ghoſt. And if thou ſaye: And howe knowe you this? They will anſwere: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath promiſed,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> that he will bee with the Church vnto the ende of the worlde. And becauſe he hath ſayde alſo: <hi>Where twoo or three are gathered in my name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.20.</note>

But whence take you theſe thinges, good men, but foorth of holie Scripture? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt rather conclude, that the Churche hath her authoritie from the Scripture. Therefore as no man dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, but the teſtimonie of the Church is greatlye to bee weyed aboute the woorde of GOD: ſo euerie man well ſeeth, that the authoritie of the Church is of greate renowme therefore, becauſe it is ſette foorth by the cleare light of God his worde.</p>

And the Church doeth not ouerrule our fayth, as they naughtely thinke. For although the duetie of the Church be, to preach, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, to reproue, to witneſſe, and to ſet forth the holy Scriptures plainely, yet doth ſhe not require to be beleued, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſpeaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of God.

For whereas the Church keepeth the ſcripture ſafe as a witneſſe, it cannot bee inferred thereby, that it is lawfull for the Church, to peruert or change anie thing in the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For ſo ſhould ſhe weaken the force of her teſtimonie, and ſhew her ſelfe to be an vntruſtie witneſſe: And this would be a corrupting, and not witneſſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: For the pure and ſimple fourme of the commandement,<note place="margin">Ambroſius de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſo. cap. 12.</note> (ſayth <hi>Ambroſe) is denounced by earneſt teſtimonies to be kept.</hi> A witneſſe, for the moſt part, when as he addeth any thing of his owne deuiſing, to the orderly report of things done, ſtaineth the whole credite of his teſtimonie,<note place="margin">A plaine and apt ſimilitude.</note> by the lying report of the part. Nothing muſt therefore be added, although it bee neuer ſo good.

And it is not to be beleeued, that the authoritie of the ſayd Notaries is of greater ſtrength, than was their willes, which requeſted that thoſe things might be ſo recorded. Neither is it any matter, that the Churche receiued the worde of God deliuered by liuely voyce, before it was committed to writing. In deede the worde (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

For it was euident, that thoſe Churches had bene continually the witneſſes and keepers of the bookes of holy Scripture: and yet they did not for that cauſe ordeyne that the authoritie of the Churche ought to be preferred before the Scriptures. But if the Apoſtolike Churche bee not preferred before the Scripture, muche leſſe ought this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of mitred men, whiche are not ſo aptly termed the Churche, as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and eating canker of the church, to bee preferred before the ſayde Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>But they obiecte againſt vs this rule, which is commonly ſpoken of by Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>Whatſoeuer it is,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:13134:88"/> But theſe felowes ought to knowe, that this ſentence giuen foorth by the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, hath place in finall cauſes. For if a man for healthes ſake vſe a medicine, he rather deſireth health, than the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. But that manner of reaſoning is not effectuall in efficient cauſes, excepte the whole and totall cauſe be conteined in the argument. For although men, which drinke wine vnmeaſurably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come drunke, we cannot therevpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the wine is rather drunke than the men: becauſe all the cauſe of drunkenneſſe is not in the wine, for it is required alſo, that it be concocted in the belly, and that the vapours be ſent vp, which may trouble the brayne. <hi>Molo</hi> the Rhetoritian inſtructed <hi>Cicero</hi> in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours arte: and yet is it not concluded thereby, that <hi>Molo</hi> was more ſkilfull in that ſcience, than was <hi>Cicero,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the maiſter is not the whole cauſe of learning, for witte, ſtudie, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is alſo required for the atteining thereof.

               <p>But it is worth the while to conſider, by what occaſion, for what cauſe, in what ſorte, and with what moderateneſſe they doe it.

If they were preſſed with the authoritie of the ſcriptures, they did either refuſe them: or if they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, they did peruert them, by putting to, and taking awaye, for the framing of their owne purpoſe: or elſe corrupted them by their peruerſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. Therefore becauſe <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> coulde not well goe forwarde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch mangling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hee doeth his diligence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the doctrine, certainly ſet foorth in the Scriptures, among the ſimple and weake, by this note alſo, that the Apoſtles deliuered it by liuely voyce from hande to hande.

                  <note place="margin">Which is the true tradition of the Apoſtles.</note> 
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> proue, that that is the true traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, which Chriſt receiued of God, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the Apoſtles: and which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles againe deliuered to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and which was kept in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by the ſucceſſion of Biſhops. And doeth this tradition conteine a doctrine contrarie to that, which is ſette foorth in the Canonicall Scripture? No. For, for this cauſe they did condemne thoſe traditions, which the Heretikes brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of, as erronious and forged. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what doeth the Tradition, alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in diſputation againſte the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, conteine? No doctrine contrarie and diſagreeable to that, which is taught in the Scripture, but the ſelfe ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of fayth, which doe (as it were) comprehend the ſumme of all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For both of them doe ſhewe, what that Tradition is, whiche the Church receiued of the Apoſtles, and alſo kept ſincere, and they bee the ſame poyntes of doctrine, whiche the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13134:104"/> Creede doeth conteine. And no man doubteth, but they are ſette foorth in the Scripture by manie manifeſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. They doe not then proue any other doctrine of fayth, beſides thoſe, which are conteined in the Scripture, but they ſhewe, and proue by tradition, the verie ſame doctrines, which are comprehended in the Scripture. And what needeth that? Forſooth, that they might proue the conſent of the true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Tradition with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo that the doctrine, whiche the Scripture doeth teach, and that which the Primitiue Churche receiued by the preaching of the Apoſtles is all one. And this is diligently to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that our poſition of the authoritie, perfection, and ſufficiencie of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is moſt ſtrongly mainteined, by this diſputation of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian:</hi> and alſo that the diſputations of the Papiſtes touching Traditions, which can bee prooued by no Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Scripture, are refuted. For the Traditions of the Apoſtles, and the Scriptures, prooue the conſente,
<pb facs="tcp:13134:105"/> ſo that the Tradition be not oppoſite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scripture, as though the Scripture were either falſe, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or vnperfect, as the Heretikes qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reled: but the trueth, the authoritie, the certaintie, and abſolute perfectneſſe of the Scripture, is proued and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the tradition. Wherefore when as there bee traditions propoſed, whiche doe not agree with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which cannot bee ſhewed and prooued foorth of the Scripture: it is moſte certaine, that thoſe traditions are not the Apoſtles. Theſe are ſure and ſounde reaſons, which can not bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen with anie ſubtile ſhiftes of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters.</p>
               <p>Now if you aſke, which that true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and Apoſtolike tradition is: it is not needful to ſearch it without the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Where as the Church hath receiued this preaching, and this faith, as wee haue before ſayde, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into the whole worlde, ſhe doth diligently keepe, as dwelling in one houſe, and in like maner beleeueth theſe things, euen as hauing one ſoule, and one heart: &amp; agreeably preacheth, and teacheth, and deliuereth the ſame, as poſſeſsing one mouth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be vnlike ſpeaches in the worlde, yet the vertue of the tradition is all one, and the verie ſame. Neither

               <p>NOw forſomuch as the name of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions hath alwayes beene a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of ſuperſtitions in the Church, and becauſe now adayes all kinde of abuſes, corruptions, and ſuperſtitions is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder their title, wee had neede to vſe heerein verie greate attentiueneſſe, and warineſſe. And in very deede whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Apoſtles yet liued, falſe prophets fayned many corruptions, which they obtruded to the Churches, and extolled for this conſideration, as though they had beene deliuered by liuely voyce from the Apoſtles, the which thing the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> do manifeſtly ſhew. VVhich was the cauſe, that the Apoſtles beganne to comprehend their doctrine in writing.

                  <note place="margin">A briefe reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of all thoſe things, which haue bene han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the holie Scripture, and the Church.</note>I haue prooued by a verie large and contentious diſputation, that the holie Scripture is God his worde, wherein is incloſed a full and a perfect ſumme of heauenly wiſedome. Neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not ſet forth in the Scriptures. For if there had beene any thing needfull to be knowne, God would not had omitted it, ſince his will was to teache vs thereby, not to the halfes, but fully whatſoeuer his pleaſure was, that wee ſhould know, and which hee knewe to bee profitable for vs. This is the onely foundation and piller of the liuely faith: this is the ſure bulwarke againſt the deceites of errours. Foorth of this ought Hereſies to bee confuted: foorth of this ought
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13134:124"/> doctrines chiefly to be diſcerned: foorth of this ought definitions of fayth, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions to be taken. The Scripture is of moſt cleare and peareleſſe authoritie, ſo that all godly and faythfull vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ought to ſerue it. And it is the Catholike conſent of the Fathers, yea, and of all the Church, that the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture ought to bee preferred before all Churches, all Councels, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee generall, all Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Decrees, deuiſes, writings of all men, although they excell in learning and holineſſe. The Church doeth ſo reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and adore the fulneſſe, perfectneſſe, and ſoundneſſe of the Scripture, that ſhe doeth accurſe as wicked and falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, as deteſtable authours of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, Hereſies, and diſſentions, as proude, vaine, and fallen from the fayth, ſo many as do preach beyonde the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yea, and ſhe ſuſpecteth euerie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, euerie prophecie, euerie Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: to bee briefe, euerie rule of faith which is not grounded in the Law, and the Prophets, and the Goſpel. And the high perfection of the chiefe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb facs="tcp:13134:125"/> of the Scripture doeth not depende of the Church, or of any teſtimonie of man, but chiefly of the witneſſe of the holy Ghoſt. For the allowing of this doctrine went before the Church, which was called, ſprong and increaſed by the worde, and which is ſtayed vp by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as by a ground worke or proppe.</p>
               <p>Although we doe not denie, that the authoritie of the Church is then of ſome weight, when as it conſenteth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both for this purpoſe, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be beleeued, and alſo for this, that the Scriptures may be well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded. But the Church doeth not make newe articles of the fayth, or a newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, but is a witneſſe and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of the true and incorrupt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, deliuered in the Scriptures, and by the voice of the Apoſtles, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth before her the light of the woorde, to put awaye the darkeneſſe brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures by Heretikes. And this is the care of the Church alwayes, to confirme by Scripture whatſoeuer
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13134:125"/> ſhee appoint. For ſhee doeth reuerently acknowledge, that her authoritie doeth ſtaye it ſelfe by the woorde, and doeth depende of the woorde. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a plaine, ſure, and infallible note of the Church. For in the Scripture, and no where elſe, in ſo great varietie of ſectes and repugnancie of opinions, is the Church to bee ſought, knowne, and prooued, and by it to bee eſteemed. Where the Scripture is heard, there is the Church, there doe the ſheepe knowe the voyce of the ſheepheard. And if the doctrine of trueth bee buried, the Church vaniſheth forthwith from mens eyes.</p>
               <p>Neither doeth the Church reigne ouer our fayth, neither doeth ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to bee beleeued, but ſo farre foorth as ſhee ſpeaketh the woordes of God. For when as ſhee doeth confeſſe, that ſhee receiueth her authoritie and credite from the Scripture onely, ſhee ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her ſelfe obediently to the holie Scriptures. Therefore whatſoeuer ſhee affirmeth, or denieth, whatſoeuer ſhee appointeth or commaundeth, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointeth
<pb facs="tcp:13134:126"/> or forbiddeth, ſhee woulde haue it knowne and beleeued, that ſhee bringeth foorth therein, not her owne, or anie other mans, or creatures, but the wordes and ſenſe of God, but of Chriſt. Therefore the Church doeth not erre, for ſhe followeth her owne iudgement in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but euery where and in all thinges obeyeth Gods worde, wherein there is no darkeneſſe, no errours. And if ſhe do otherwiſe, this ſaying of Scripture is true:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.4. 1. Tim. 3.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Let euerie man be a lyer, and God <hi>onely</hi> true.</hi> In deede the Church is the piller and ground of truth: becauſe ſhe is keeper of ſounde doctrine: and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth it to them, which come after, leaſt it ſhould faile in the worlde. And that is the holie and diuine Scripture, which the conſent of the Church doeth allowe and approoue: but this conſent and this approbation is not the deuiſe of man, but a neceſſarie confeſſion, and a teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation expreſſed by the force of the truth, which doeth not bring to paſſe, that the authoritie of the Church is greater or of like credite with the authoritie of the Scripture.</p>

But the ſpouſe of Chriſt, heareth the voice of her bridegroome, and ſubmitteth her ſelfe to him, as it is meete. Her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie is not to bee withdrawne from the ſingleneſſe of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth.<note place="margin">2.
